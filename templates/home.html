        Dr. Bharat Garg has completed his Ph.D. “Energy Efficient Accuracy Aware VLSI Architectures for Image Processing Applications using Approximate Computing” from ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior in 2017. Currently, he is working as Assistant Professor in Electronics and Communication Engineering Department in Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala since 2017. Prior to his PhD, he has worked with the semiconductor industries namely “Cypress Semiconductors India Private Limited” and “Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Hyderabad” from year 2007- 2010. While working with these industries, he has worked on the design and verification of different projects including “design of universal digital block”, “IO subsystem design”, “memory design and verification”. On a project assignment of “Programmable SoC Design”, he has worked on Cypress Semiconductors, Washington USA for a month. He is efficient in HDL (VHDL and Verilog), C, C+, MATLAB and have good working experience with CAD tools namely Synopsys, Mentor Graphics, and Xilinx FPGA design flow. His research interest includes the design and development of high performance arithmetic unit, energy efficient VLSI architectures for image processing and hardware security. He is very efficient in signal/image processing and working since 5 years. He has authored more than 40 research papers in the international journal/conference of repute including IEEE transactions and letters.
